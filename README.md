##### *Growing plants over a period of time, analysing the results and drawing conclusions* 

### 1. Introduction
Plants are exposed to different conditions during their period of growth, which affect them in different ways. The goal of this lab is to out if there are any observable differences between these two samples of plants : 
 - Sample with a stable temperature and normal indoor conditions
 - Sample with a changing temperature but otherwise normal conditions.


### 2. Hyptothesis
The sample subject to changing temperatures is going to show signs of slower and more uneven development compared to the sample with "regular" indoor conditions. This will be reflected in either growth, size, amount of nutrition or any combination of these.
