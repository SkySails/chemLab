##### *Growing plants over a period of time, analysing the results and writing down differences* 

### 1. Introduction
Plants are exposed to different conditions during their period of growth, which affect them in different ways. The goal of this lab is to find out if there are any observable differences in the matured plants between these two samples of plants : 
 - Sample grown with a stable temperature and normal indoor conditions
 - Sample growm with a changing temperature but otherwise normal conditions.

### 2. Hyptothesis
The sample subject to changing temperatures is going to show signs of slower and more uneven development compared to the sample with "regular" indoor conditions. This will be reflected in either growth, size, amount of nutrition, amount of chlorophyll or any combination of these.

### 3. Materials
- plants (Lepidium genus)
- growbed with soil and water (8 pcs, 4 for each sample)

For measuring the temperatures around the plants:
- Raspberry Pi
- Temperature sensor (model: DS18B20)
- Wire

### 4. Procedure
This lab is to be carried out over a 4 week period, starting Thursday 2019-01-31.
The first week the growbeds with plants are going to be set up, as well as the measuring equipment. After that, the plants will be looked at once a week. After the lab is finished, the temperature measurements will be analyzed as well as the size, weight and amount of chlorophyll of the plants. If any differences are found between both samples, it's to be written down.
